# Exploration of the Airbnb Market in NYC

## What is it?
In this project, insights about the Airbnb market in New York City are uncovered.   

With the derived insights, we can answer questions such as:  
1. What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?  
2. How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market in NYC?  
3. How many Airbnb listings are for each room type?  
4. How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the 5 NYC boroughs?   
5. How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the 3 room types?


## Note
While the dataset used is for 2019, which means that the Airbnb market might be different from the current one, 
it is still a good opportunity to explore its market and compare to the market in the following years.
